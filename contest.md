# Our solution introduced:

Iterating on improvement from Round 1 we have implemented:
- Improved ESG dialog, with unified text and custom emojis;
- Support searching for emojis/stickers and GIFs based on text
     and filtering by categories (e.g. cheers or love) in ESG;
- Refined text editing by fixing few small issues including
     scrolling, quote formatting, and combined entity handling;
- Added ability to preview resulting message (with markdown
     applied) when unfocusing edit field or through TextFormatter.

Refresher on improvements from Round 1:
- New UI for folder tabs
- A setting (on the Chat Folder page) to choose the old or new Folder UI;
- WebGL-based gradient backgrounds;
- Optimizations and fixes for Composer component;
- New flexible and reusable RiccphInput component;
- Improved markdown parser.
